"""reflection_facet_memory_routing.py — the ``knowledge_routing`` reflection facet.

PORTABLE example facet. Reflection dimension: *knowledge-routing (memory vs runbook)*.

When the operator banks a private-memory topic file, this facet reflects: is this a
true contextual one-off, or is it durable, generalizable know-how that belongs in a
SHARED, committed, discoverable home (a runbook, a design doc, a house-rules rule)?
And — the no-home clause — if NO existing shared home fits, the *absence* of a home
may itself be a structural-gap signal (→ surface to the user / add to a backlog),
not automatically a one-off.

Fires on the ON_MEMORY_WRITE tempo (a PostToolUse ``Write|Edit`` into a memory
dir), a DISTINCT window from the ON_TURN_END facets — a memory write is a discrete,
operator-initiated bank moment, not a recurring tick.

**Classification:** the written path resolves against the configured memory dir(s):

  - a ``Write`` to a topic path  → NEW_TOPIC_FILE   → NUDGE (route-check).
  - an ``Edit`` to a topic path  → EDIT_TOPIC_FILE  → NUDGE (a rewrite can be a new
    learning).
  - a write to the index file    → MEMORY_INDEX_EDIT → PROCEED (bookkeeping, not a
    learning; nudging it is noise).
  - not under a memory dir       → PROCEED (the cheap early-return).

To adapt: set ``REFLECTION_MEMORY_DIRS`` (os.pathsep-joined absolute dirs) to YOUR
private-memory store(s), and re-word ``ROUTE_CHECK_TEXT`` for your shared homes.
