# rhetoric.md — a rhetoric toolkit for technical prose

This is an **agent-facing** style doc — a resource of the `self-communicate` skill, not a catalogue entry.
It is not rendered to HTML or served.

## Why this file exists

The so-called "LLM tells" — the em-dash everywhere, the rule of three, the reflexive "not X, but Y" —
are not defects. They are **classical rhetorical devices** that have worked for two thousand years. The
problem is never the device. The problem is **mechanical overuse and sameness**: the same three figures on
repeat, at the same cadence, until the prose reads as a machine running one loop.

The fix is not to ban the figures. The fix is a **broad toolkit used with variety and taste**. A tricolon
lands when it is the *only* tricolon on the page; it becomes a tic when every paragraph has one. So:

- **Variety and fit are the craft.** Reach for the figure that fits the sentence, and don't reach for the
  same one twice in a row.
- **Any single figure on repeat is the tell.** Count your em-dashes. Count your rule-of-threes. If one
  device recurs on a fixed beat, that recurrence — not the device — is what a reader clocks as artificial.
- **Match the house voice.** See [`voice.md`](voice.md) for how the house author actually
  deploys these. He uses many of them; he varies constantly; he leans on the period and the plain word as
  often as the dash.

Below: the toolkit, grouped by what the device *does*. For each — **name · definition · a
technical-writing example · a "use tastefully" note** (when it lands, when it becomes a tic).

## Group 1 — Balance & parallelism

- **Tricolon (the rule of three)** · three parallel phrases or clauses in a row. · *"It fails fast, it
  logs the cause, and it surfaces a typed error."* · **Tastefully:** one strong tricolon per section is
  memorable; three tricolons on one page is the single most recognizable LLM cadence. Vary the count —
  sometimes list two, sometimes four.
- **Isocolon** · successive clauses of equal length and matching structure. · *"Guidance aims; machinery
  holds."* · **Tastefully:** the symmetry is the point — use it when the two halves genuinely balance.
  Forcing equal length on unequal ideas reads as sing-song.
- **Antithesis** · two contrasting ideas set in parallel structure. · *"A wrong remediation is worse than
  a slow one."* · **Tastefully:** superb for a sharp contrast. But a whole document written in
  antithesis-cadence (every sentence a this-versus-that) flattens into monotony — let some sentences just
  assert.
- **Parallelism** · matching grammatical shape across successive clauses. · *"Read via the model, write via
  the model, validate via the model."* · **Tastefully:** parallel structure aids scanning. Break it
  deliberately when you want one item to stand out.
- **Chiasmus** · two parallel phrases with the second reversing the order of the first (ABBA). · *"We test
  what we ship and ship what we test."* · **Tastefully:** striking once; precious if overused. Save it for
  a claim you want quoted.
- **Antimetabole** · chiasmus done at the word level — the same words reversed for contrast. · *"The map
  equals the territory, or the territory has outrun the map."* · **Tastefully:** the most quotable figure
  and the most easily overcooked. One per document, at most.
- **Climax (gradatio)** · phrases arranged in rising order of force. · *"It slows the build, then breaks
  the gate, then blocks the release."* · **Tastefully:** builds momentum toward a payoff. Needs a genuine
  escalation, or it feels padded.

## Group 2 — The "not X, but Y" family (correction & contrast)

These are the figures behind the reflexive "not X, but Y" tell. Named precisely, they are three different
moves — and knowing which one you mean is how you stop defaulting to the same phrasing.

- **Correctio** · retract a first framing and replace it with a sharper one. · *"The gate isn't slow — it
  is thorough, which costs a few seconds."* · **Tastefully:** use it to *redefine*, so the two halves
  carry different content. If Y merely restates X in nicer words, cut the setup and just say Y.
- **Antithesis (as "not X, but Y")** · the contrastive form: reject X, affirm the opposing Y. · *"Not a
  faster path, but a correct one."* · **Tastefully:** the canonical LLM cadence. It is fine occasionally
  and deadly on repeat. When you catch a third "not X, but Y" in a page, rewrite two of them as plain
  claims.
- **Metanoia** · qualify or walk back a statement you just made, mid-stride. · *"It catches every case —
  or every case we've named a test for."* · **Tastefully:** honest and human when the qualification is
  real. A crutch if every claim gets one; sometimes a claim should stand unqualified.

## Group 3 — Omission & addition

- **Asyndeton** · drop the conjunctions. · *"It builds, tests, lints, ships."* · **Tastefully:** speeds a
  list and adds urgency. Overused it reads clipped and breathless.
- **Polysyndeton** · pile the conjunctions on. · *"The worker crashes and the job stalls and the queue
  backs up and nothing surfaces."* · **Tastefully:** conveys accumulation or dread. A rare tool — one use
  per document lands; more feels mannered.
- **Zeugma** · one verb governs two objects in different senses. · *"The lint caught the bug and the
  reviewer's eye."* · **Tastefully:** a clever grace note. Deploy at most once, where the double meaning is
  actually apt; a strained zeugma is worse than none.
- **Hendiadys** · express one idea with two nouns joined by "and". · *"the noise and confusion of an
  undocumented seam."* · **Tastefully:** adds texture. In terse technical prose it often just doubles a
  word — prefer one precise noun unless the pair earns its keep.

## Group 4 — Repetition for structure

- **Anaphora** · successive sentences open with the same words. · *"It must fail loud. It must log the
  cause. It must leave a typed error."* · **Tastefully:** powerful for a deliberate build. Two or three
  repetitions land; a fourth tips into oratory that clashes with plain technical prose.
- **Epistrophe** · successive clauses *end* with the same words. · *"The lint enforces it. The gate
  enforces it. The reviewer trusts that both enforce it."* · **Tastefully:** rarer and quieter than
  anaphora — use when the repeated tail is the point.
- **Symploce** · anaphora and epistrophe together (same start and end). · *"We govern the agent, we govern
  the model, we govern the product."* · **Tastefully:** strong closing figure; one per document.
- **Epizeuxis** · repeat a single word for emphasis. · *"This path is slow, slow enough to notice."* ·
  **Tastefully:** a spotlight. Once, on the word that matters.
- **Anadiplosis** · begin a clause with the word that ended the last. · *"The gate blocks the merge; the
  merge that would have shipped the regression."* · **Tastefully:** chains ideas smoothly. A whole
  paragraph of it becomes a gimmick.

## Group 5 — Objection-handling (the "they say / I say" moves)

- **Hypophora** · pose the question the reader is forming, then answer it. · *"Why not just review for it?
  Because review is post-hoc and the lint is at-commit."* · **Tastefully:** excellent for pacing an
  argument. Overused it turns every point into a mock-Socratic dialogue.
- **Procatalepsis / prolepsis** · raise and rebut an objection before the reader can. · *"You might say
  this is over-engineered. It isn't: the failure it prevents cost us a release."* · **Tastefully:** the
  strongest tool for a contested claim. Deploy on the two or three objections that actually bite, not on
  every claim.
- **Praeteritio (paralipsis)** · mention a thing by declining to dwell on it. · *"I'll set aside the
  obvious cost argument and focus on correctness."* · **Tastefully:** useful to acknowledge-and-move-on.
  Reads as coy if you "decline" to discuss what you clearly want to.
- **Aporia** · a stated (often feigned) doubt, for rhetorical setup. · *"It's not obvious which failure
  this even is."* · **Tastefully:** honest when the doubt is real and you then resolve it. Skip the feigned
  version in technical writing — it wastes the reader's time.

## Group 6 — Understatement, emphasis & substitution

- **Litotes** · affirm by negating the opposite; understatement. · *"This is not a cheap check to run."* ·
  **Tastefully:** dry emphasis. A page of double negatives is hard to parse — use sparingly and never
  stack two litotes in one sentence.
- **Metonymy** · name a thing by something closely associated with it. · *"the merge train" for the batched
  landing pipeline.* · **Tastefully:** natural and compact when the association is shared. Obscure metonymy
  confuses a reader who lacks the reference — the interpretability rule bites here.
- **Rhetorical question** · a question posed for effect, not an answer (often paired with hypophora). ·
  *"What good is a gate that never fires?"* · **Tastefully:** ask only a question whose answer changes the
  reader's model of the argument. Do not convert an ordinary transition into a rhetorical question — on a
  regular beat they read as padding, anticipating an objection every paragraph. When the answer leaves the
  reader's understanding unchanged, make it a plain assertion.
- **Direct address** · speak to the reader as "you". · *"You'll hit this the first time two agents share a
  worktree."* · **Tastefully:** warms the prose and matches the house voice. Keep it occasional — constant
  second-person turns instructional prose preachy.

## Metaphor → operational meaning → boundary

Metaphors are models too. A recurring metaphor may stay even when it is not technically exact, as long as
it does real explanatory work — the same license this file gives every other figure, applied to the
sustained conceptual image. A metaphor is not the decorative prose the "no literary-cute" rule cuts
([`voice.md`](voice.md) §"Drift tells"); it is a mental model the reader reasons with.

**Preserve a metaphor when it** gives the reader a stable mental handle, predicts useful behavior, recurs
across the book, and can be followed by a precise statement of its boundary. The catalogue runs several:

- **map and territory** — for a model and the system it represents.
- **the model bridge** — for the representation the agents reason across.
- **the printer** — shifts diagnosis from the machine's "personality" to its instructions and environment.
- **the pink elephant** — a prohibition that makes the forbidden action cognitively salient.

Do not replace a working metaphor with sterile precision. Run the sequence instead:

1. **the metaphor** — the memorable image;
2. **its operational meaning** — what it actually asserts;
3. **the boundary** — where the image stops.

Prefer "the map must stay equal to the territory" in the sentence the reader remembers, then "equal over
the relations the model claims to represent" when precision matters. The vivid line carries the idea; the
boundary clause keeps it honest. This is the prose twin of the metaphor registry, which records each
sustained image and the declared idea it elaborates — the model holds the one-image-per-idea line; this
rule says how to write the image once it is registered.

## The one rule that governs all of them

Every figure above is legitimate. The tell is never a single use — it is **sameness and density**: the
same figure on a fixed beat, or a paragraph so dense with figures that the argument disappears under the
ornament. Write the point plainly first. Then reach for *one* figure where it genuinely sharpens the
sentence, and reach for a *different* one next time.
