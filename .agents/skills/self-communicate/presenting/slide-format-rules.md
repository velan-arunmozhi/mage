# Slide Format Rules

Mechanical, visual, and accessibility constraints for generated or
revised slide decks.

These rules complement the conceptual guidance in `talk.md`, `deck.md`,
`slide.md`, `presentation-types.md`, and the local style guide. They are
deliberately more prescriptive: where the other resources explain how to
reason about a presentation, this file establishes defaults and
mechanically auditable constraints for realizing it.

Treat violations as defects unless the slide has a deliberate,
defensible reason to depart from the rule.

# Typography

-   **No audience-facing text below 20 pt.**
-   Treat 20 pt as a floor, not a target. Prefer substantially larger
    text for primary content.
-   If content does not fit at 20 pt, shorten it, restructure it, split
    the slide, simplify the representation, or move detail to notes or
    backup material. **Do not solve overcrowding by shrinking the
    type.**
-   Slide titles should normally fit on **one line**.
-   Do not shrink a title merely to preserve an overlong formulation.
    Rewrite it.
-   Use a small, consistent type hierarchy. Avoid gratuitous changes in
    font family, weight, and size.
-   Sentence case is the default unless an established template requires
    otherwise.
-   Use bold, italics, and other typographic emphasis sparingly. If
    everything is emphasized, nothing is.
-   Avoid using typography alone to encode an essential semantic
    distinction.

## Diagram typography

-   Text inside diagrams is subject to the same 20 pt audience-text floor as
    other audience-facing text.
-   Treat 20 pt as especially undesirable for important diagram labels,
    questions, and decision nodes. Increase important labels substantially
    above the floor when space permits.
-   Comparable labels must use consistent typography. Axis labels, peer
    component labels, alternative headings, and repeated annotations should
    not drift in font size, weight, or style.
-   Do not shrink text to fit a decision diamond, process box, or other diagram
    shape. Enlarge the shape or shorten the wording.

# Titles

A title should tell the audience what intellectual work the slide is
doing.

-   A slide title should convey the **idea, claim, question, or
    intellectual role of the slide**, not merely name its contents.
-   Use assertion titles by default for slides making technical claims.
-   Use question titles when the audience is meant to reason before the
    answer is supplied.
-   Topic titles are acceptable for genuine orientation, reference,
    activity, or section slides.
-   Avoid generic titles such as `Background`, `Results`,
    `Architecture`, or `Key Takeaways` when a more informative title is
    available.
-   Prefer:
    -   `Implementation capacity is no longer the primary constraint`
    -   `What becomes scarce?`
-   Avoid:
    -   `Implementation Capacity`
    -   `Scarcity`
-   Reusing the same title across a short build sequence is acceptable
    when the evolving visual underneath it is the point.
-   Every slide should also have a meaningful structural title for
    accessibility and navigation. The structural title may be visually
    hidden when the design genuinely requires it, but it should not be
    omitted.

## Title punctuation

-   Do not end an ordinary slide title with a period.
-   Avoid em dashes in audience-facing slide text. Rewrite using punctuation or
    sentence structure appropriate to the relationship.
-   Do not alter punctuation inside quotations, code, requirements, citations,
    or other material being reproduced verbatim.

# Layout and visual hierarchy

-   Keep the title in a predictable location across ordinary content
    slides.
-   Give every slide a clear primary visual hierarchy.
-   Make the primary visual, claim, question, or evidence region
    perceptually dominant.
-   Do not fill unused space merely because it is available.
-   Avoid layouts that divide attention among several equally weighted
    boxes without a clear reading path.
-   Prefer direct spatial grouping over borders, cards, panels, and
    decorative containers.
-   Keep meaningful content away from slide edges so it survives
    projection, display cropping, and export.
-   Align objects deliberately. Near-alignment looks accidental and
    increases visual noise.
-   Use white space to establish hierarchy and grouping, not as an
    aesthetic quota.
-   Do not force every slide into the same layout. Let the
    representation follow the intellectual job.

# Text density

-   Paragraphs are exceptional on audience-facing slides.
-   Bullets are appropriate only when the content is genuinely a list.
-   Do not convert speaker narration into bullets merely because the
    information exists.
-   Prefer labels, short annotations, compact statements, equations,
    examples, and visible relationships.
-   If a slide requires sustained reading while the speaker is also
    talking, reconsider the representation.
-   Material intended for careful self-paced reading may belong in
    notes, backup material, a handout, or a companion document.
-   Dense technical evidence is permitted when the detail itself
    matters. Improve hierarchy, annotation, and signaling before
    deleting evidence.
-   Do not compress wording until a technical claim becomes less
    precise.

## Compress prose into speaking structure

Slides are not speaker notes. When audience-facing text becomes prose-like,
preserve the argument while separating what the audience needs to SEE from
what the speaker needs to SAY.

Prefer:

    idea-bearing title
    short labels / phrases / compact bullets
    visual evidence or structure

and move explanation, qualification, examples, transitions, and supporting
prose into speaker notes.

Do not "fix" excessive prose merely by placing each sentence behind a bullet.
A bullet that is still a sentence-sized unit of exposition is usually prose
with a bullet attached.

As a diagnostic, revise when:

-   the audience must read paragraphs or several complete sentences while
    listening to the speaker;
-   bullets encode the speaker's explanation rather than the structure the
    audience needs to retain;
-   the slide duplicates substantial portions of the speaker notes;
-   explanatory qualifications crowd out the slide's main relationships or
    evidence.

Compress toward memorable words, phrases, relationships, and evidence. Put
the connective argument in the notes.

This is a semantic rule, not a word-count rule. A quotation, definition,
requirement, or other text that the audience must inspect verbatim may
appropriately remain on the slide.

# Figures, diagrams, and evidence

-   A visual must explain, demonstrate, compare, orient, or provide
    evidence. Do not add imagery merely to make a slide look designed.
-   Prefer diagrams that expose real semantics: objects, boundaries,
    flows, dependencies, hierarchy, transformations, authority,
    feedback, or constraints.
-   Prefer direct labels on diagrams and charts over detached legends
    where practical.
-   Annotate the specific feature the speaker is discussing so the
    audience knows where to look.
-   Preserve enough resolution, axes, units, baselines, denominators,
    uncertainty, and context to keep evidence honest.
-   Do not replace a technically useful figure with a generic
    infographic merely for aesthetic simplicity.
-   Avoid decorative stock photography and generic AI-generated imagery.
-   Use photographs when the actual physical object, scene, analogy, or
    event matters.
-   Screenshots should be cropped to the relevant region and annotated
    when the audience otherwise would not know where to look.
-   Do not flatten editable, semantic content into an image merely for
    convenience.
-   When a figure evolves across slides, preserve the established visual
    frame and modify or highlight the changed portion where practical.

## Connector geometry and attachment

For technical box-and-arrow diagrams:

-   Connectors must terminate on the objects they connect. Floating endpoints
    are defects.
-   Prefer native connectors attached to shape connection points rather than
    independent line objects.
-   Prefer orthogonal, right-angle routing between rectangular components.
-   Use diagonal routing only when it carries meaning or clearly improves the
    representation.
-   Route connectors around labels and objects rather than through them.
-   Arrowheads must terminate cleanly at the destination object and must be
    large enough to remain perceptible at presentation distance.
-   Connector strokes must be visibly substantial under projection. Do not use
    hairline strokes for meaningful relationships.
-   Comparable connectors within a diagram should use consistent stroke weight
    and arrowhead scale.
-   Dependency arrows, flow arrows, control arrows, and other directed
    relationships must point in the semantically correct direction.

When editing an existing diagram, redraw a poorly routed connector rather than
merely nudging an independent line until it appears approximately attached.

# Quantitative material

-   Use a chart when the quantitative **pattern** matters.
-   Use a table when exact **lookup or comparison** matters.
-   Use a direct number when the number itself is the point.
-   Show denominators, baselines, distributions, uncertainty, or other
    context when they materially affect interpretation.
-   Label axes and units directly and legibly.
-   Annotate the comparison or relationship the audience is expected to
    notice.
-   Do not distort visual magnitude, area, scale, or ordering to
    exaggerate an effect.
-   A large number can establish scale; it should not substitute for
    necessary context.

# Color and emphasis

-   Use color sparingly and semantically.
-   **Do not encode essential meaning by color alone.**
-   Pair color distinctions with labels, shape, position, pattern,
    symbols, or another non-color cue.
-   Prefer position, scale, weight, and restrained highlighting before
    introducing additional colors.
-   One accent treatment is usually stronger than several competing
    emphasis styles.
-   Maintain sufficient foreground/background contrast for projection
    and accessibility.
-   Avoid gradients, ornamental shadows, glows, and decorative effects
    unless they carry information.
-   Ensure important distinctions remain understandable under weak
    projection and, where practical, grayscale.

### Do not use decorative 3D effects

Do not use PowerPoint's decorative 3D rendering features, including:

- 3D rotation or perspective applied for visual effect;
- bevels and extruded shapes;
- faux depth on charts or diagrams;
- 3D pie, bar, column, or area charts; and
- other dimensional effects that make a fundamentally two-dimensional
  representation appear three-dimensional.

These effects add visual noise, can distort quantitative or spatial
relationships, and are inconsistent with the deck's preference for
literal, inspectable representations.

This rule does not prohibit genuinely three-dimensional technical
content. When the third spatial dimension is part of the information
being communicated — for example, a physical structure, geometry, or
spatial model — represent it as necessary to communicate that
information.

Audit:

- Is any 3D treatment merely decorative?
- Does perspective, extrusion, or depth distort the represented
  relationship or quantity?
- If a representation is three-dimensional, does the third dimension
  carry actual information?

# Builds and animation

-   Use builds to control reasoning, not to add motion.
-   Reveal a component when the audience is ready to reason about it.
-   Preserve object positions across builds whenever possible.
-   Highlight changes to an established representation rather than
    replacing the representation unnecessarily.
-   Each build should add conceptual meaning.
-   Avoid entrance-animation theater and motion whose only purpose is
    visual novelty.
-   Do not make essential information available only during a transient
    animation.
-   The final static state should remain intelligible when the deck is
    exported to PDF.
-   When animation is essential to understanding change or sequence,
    provide a static representation or equivalent that survives
    distribution.

## Conceptual build granularity

A build should correspond to a conceptual change in what the audience is being
asked to understand.

-   Reveal related objects together when they form one conceptual unit.
-   Do not require multiple clicks merely because a conceptual unit was
    constructed from multiple PowerPoint objects.
-   On comparison slides, normally establish the alternatives before revealing
    the synthesized tradeoff or conclusion.
-   When the final artifact is a complete diagram or table, prefer
    reveal-by-masking when that preserves alignment, editability, and the final
    static representation better than constructing the artifact incrementally.

## Speaker-note realization

When the output format supports rich text in speaker notes, realize emphasis
as actual formatting:

-   the opening `TIME — message` line uses native italics for the message;
-   bold and italics elsewhere use native rich-text runs;
-   do not leave Markdown `*`, `**`, or similar formatting markers in the
    rendered notes.

The conceptual source `2 minutes — *Technology shifts the bottleneck.*` must
appear in PowerPoint as `2 minutes — Technology shifts the bottleneck.` with
the message actually italicized.

## Animation-note consistency

`ANIMATE` is an executable delivery cue, not a rhetorical placeholder. Before
emitting `ANIMATE`:

1.  inspect the slide's actual animation sequence;
2.  verify that an animation occurs at that point;
3.  verify that the marker corresponds to the correct click/build;
4.  omit the marker if no such animation exists.

When generating a new slide, do not write notes that promise an animation
that has not been implemented. Either implement the intended animation and
then add the cue, or leave both absent.

As an audit invariant:

    ANIMATE in notes  =>  corresponding animation/build exists

The converse need not be absolute — trivial or automatically timed animation
may not require a speaking cue — but every click-driven conceptual build that
affects delivery should normally carry a corresponding cue in detailed notes.

## Animation realization

Prefer simple entrance, exit, and emphasis behavior. For progressive
sequences:

-   use **Appear** for straightforward introduction;
-   where previous material should remain as context, make the new material
    appear while the previous material becomes transparent on the same click;
-   where previous material is no longer useful, make it disappear as the new
    material appears;
-   when multiple objects remain visible and grouping becomes ambiguous, use
    a thin border to distinguish the active or newly introduced object.

Do not substitute unsupported animation behavior with prose in the notes. If
the authoring library cannot reliably create the intended PowerPoint
animation, preserve the static slide and omit `ANIMATE` rather than claiming
the build exists. When editing an existing presentation, preserve its
established animation vocabulary unless there is a concrete reason to change
it.

### Reveal by masking

For staged revelation of a large figure, diagram, or table, the preferred
house technique is often:

1.  place the complete final artifact on the slide;
2.  overlay opaque boxes matching the slide background over content that
    should initially be hidden;
3.  order the masks according to the intended reveal sequence;
4.  apply **Disappear** animations to the masks;
5.  remove each mask on the click corresponding to that conceptual reveal.

Treat the masks as presentation controls, not as parts of the underlying
figure; keep the complete artifact intact beneath them. Speaker-note
`ANIMATE` markers should correspond to the disappearance of these masks just
as they do to other click-driven conceptual builds.

# Citations and provenance

-   Cite external figures, quotations, data, and consequential sourced
    claims.
-   Keep citations visually subordinate to the evidence they support,
    but **keep them readable**.
-   Citations and source labels are audience-facing text and should not
    become microscopic exceptions to the 20 pt rule merely because they
    are citations.
-   When full bibliographic detail would overwhelm the slide, use a
    compact readable citation on-slide and retain complete provenance in
    notes or backup material.
-   Prefer meaningful source labels to unexplained raw URLs.
-   Do not allow citations or URLs to dominate the evidence they
    support.

# Accessibility by construction

Build accessibility into the source deck. Accessibility is substantially
easier to preserve, audit, or remediate later when the source already
contains semantic text, meaningful object order, structural titles, and
descriptions of visuals.

## Alt text and visuals

-   Give every meaningful **figure, image, chart, diagram, and
    screenshot useful alt text** in the source deck.
-   Write alt text for the **communicative purpose** of the visual, not
    merely its appearance.
-   For a chart, include the important trend, comparison, or conclusion
    a sighted audience is expected to obtain.
-   For a diagram, include the important objects and relationships
    needed to understand its role in the talk.
-   For a screenshot, identify the relevant interface state or feature
    rather than exhaustively describing incidental pixels.
-   Mark purely decorative images as decorative rather than inventing
    meaningless alt text.
-   If a visual contains essential text that cannot remain native slide
    text, ensure the relevant information is represented accessibly
    elsewhere.
-   Do not assume a filename, caption, or surrounding title is an
    adequate substitute for alt text when the visual itself carries
    additional meaning.

## Native semantics

-   Keep text as real slide text where practical.
-   Use native slide lists, tables, charts, and shapes where they
    preserve useful structure.
-   Avoid flattening an entire slide, diagram, or table into a
    screenshot when the content can remain semantic.
-   Give charts meaningful titles and directly label important series,
    values, axes, units, and relationships.
-   Give tables a simple logical structure where practical.
-   Avoid using tables solely as a layout mechanism.
-   Avoid merged or unnecessarily complex table structures when a
    simpler structure communicates the same information.

## Prefer native semantic constructs

Do not reconstruct a named PowerPoint concept from generic primitives
when PowerPoint already provides an appropriate semantic construct.

When the intended representation maps cleanly onto a native object,
prefer constructs such as:

- slide layouts and placeholders;
- SmartArt;
- charts;
- tables;
- equations;
- media objects; and
- other native structured objects

over manually assembled collections of text boxes, shapes, lines, and
arrows.

Use **SmartArt when its semantic model fits the content**. Appropriate
uses include simple processes, cycles, hierarchies, relationships, and
other structures directly represented by an available SmartArt type.

Do not distort a technical model merely to fit an available SmartArt
template. Native does not automatically mean appropriate; the
representation must still carry the intended intellectual structure.

Use this general precedence when realizing a slide:

1. **Existing deck layout/type** — reuse the deck's established visual
   and structural vocabulary where it fits.
2. **Native semantic object** — use SmartArt, chart, table, equation,
   media object, or another native construct when its semantics match
   the content.
3. **Reusable custom type** — when a recurring slide structure is not
   represented, add it to the slide master/layout vocabulary rather
   than repeatedly constructing it locally.
4. **Hand-built one-off** — use generic shapes/text boxes only when the
   representation is genuinely exceptional or native/reusable
   constructs cannot express it adequately.

The goal is not to maximize use of PowerPoint features. The goal is to
preserve semantics, editability, accessibility, theme integration, and
maintainability while using a representation appropriate to the idea.

Native objects do not remove accessibility obligations. SmartArt,
charts, tables, and other structured objects must still have appropriate
alt text or accessible equivalents, sensible reading order, sufficient
contrast, and any other metadata or structure required for the content.

Audit:

- Is a named PowerPoint construct being unnecessarily reconstructed
  from generic shapes or text boxes?
- Would SmartArt express this process, cycle, hierarchy, or relationship
  faithfully?
- Is SmartArt being used merely because it is available, despite a poor
  semantic fit?
- Could a native chart, table, equation, or media object replace a
  hand-built approximation?
- Does the chosen native object remain editable and theme-aware?
- Has the native object still been given the required accessibility
  metadata and checked for sensible reading order?

## Reuse and extend the deck's native slide vocabulary

Treat the deck's theme, slide masters, layouts, placeholders, and established slide types as reusable
presentation infrastructure.

When constructing a slide, use this precedence:

1. **Reuse an existing suitable slide layout/type.**
2. **If a recurring need is not represented, add a new reusable layout/type to the slide master and use it
   from there.**
3. **Use one-off hand-positioned construction only when the slide is genuinely exceptional and cannot
   reasonably be represented as a reusable type.**

Do not create a new recurring slide pattern by copying coordinates, formatting, text boxes, or shapes onto
individual slides. If the pattern constitutes a new kind of slide, make it part of the deck's
slide-master/layout vocabulary.

Prefer placeholders and theme-derived formatting over independently styled text boxes and shapes. Preserve
native PowerPoint semantics wherever practical.

This is an engineering rule, not merely a visual-style preference. Reusable master/layout types improve:

- accessibility and predictable structure;
- semantic reading order;
- editability;
- theme-wide consistency;
- maintainability;
- reliable agentic generation; and
- later global changes to typography, spacing, and layout.

Before adding a new master/layout type, verify that an existing type cannot express the intended
relationship cleanly. Do not proliferate nearly identical layouts.

Audit:

- Does this slide use an existing suitable deck layout/type?
- If it introduces a recurring visual structure, was that structure added to the slide master rather than
  implemented locally?
- Are placeholders and theme styles used instead of hand-rolled equivalents?
- Has the change unnecessarily duplicated an existing layout?
- Would a future theme/master edit correctly propagate to this slide?

## Native deck structure

For PowerPoint/O365 decks:

- Use native **Sections** for major module/talk movements.
- Give every section a meaningful label.
- Keep section names consistent with the visible module outline and the movement vocabulary.
- Do not substitute divider slides for native Sections.
- Do not require a divider slide merely because a Section begins.

Opening (the first two slides):

- **Lecture/module** — Slide 1 is the cover; Slide 2 is the module outline. The outline describes the
  module's intellectual movements, not slide ranges or administrative agenda items.
- **Research talk** — Slide 1 is the cover; Slide 2 is the contributions slide. All principal contributions
  fit on that single slide, and state substantive knowledge/capability rather than sections of the
  presentation. Do not put a generic outline/agenda on slide 2.

Audit:

- Does slide 2 provide the correct orientation for the presentation type — for a lecture, where the
  reasoning is going; for a research talk, what the work contributes?
- Does the outline (lecture) accurately represent the talk's movements?
- Are major movements represented with native, meaningfully-named PowerPoint Sections?
- Do outline labels, Section names, and movement terminology agree?
- Are visible section dividers used only where they help the audience perceive a meaningful transition?

## Slide titles

-   Give every slide a meaningful, unique **structural title**.
-   Prefer using the slide's actual title placeholder or equivalent
    structural title field.
-   The structural title should support navigation and identification by
    assistive technology.
-   If a visible slide intentionally has no title, retain an appropriate
    structural title rather than leaving the slide unnamed.

## Reading and object order

PowerPoint reading order follows the slide's object/z-order rather than
the visual left-to-right or top-to-bottom arrangement.

-   **Create objects in the intended semantic reading order whenever
    possible.** For generated slides, insertion order should be
    deliberate from the beginning.
-   Treat correct insertion order as the default way to obtain
    accessible reading order "for free."
-   Visual position does not establish semantic reading order.
-   If later editing, duplication, grouping, or rearrangement changes
    object order, explicitly reorder the objects before finalizing the
    slide.
-   The intended reading sequence should remain understandable without
    relying on visual position alone.
-   Group objects only when grouping preserves rather than obscures the
    intended semantics.

## Color and nonvisual meaning

-   Do not use color as the sole carrier of state, category,
    correctness, emphasis, or other essential meaning.
-   Do not use visual position, font styling, shape, or size as the sole
    carrier of an essential distinction unless the same distinction is
    also available semantically or textually.
-   Give important relationships explicit labels where a nonvisual
    reader would otherwise lose them.

## Links

-   Use descriptive link text for audience-facing hyperlinks.
-   Avoid `click here`, `more`, or an unexplained raw URL when a
    meaningful label is practical.
-   Ensure the link text makes sense independently of its visual
    position.

## Audio and video

-   Provide captions for video containing meaningful speech or audio.
-   Provide an appropriate transcript or equivalent alternative when
    needed for distributed material.
-   Do not rely on audio alone to communicate information that has no
    accessible alternative.

## Export and distribution

-   Accessibility in the source deck does not guarantee accessibility
    after conversion.
-   When exporting or distributing the deck, verify that structural
    titles, alt text, reading order, links, and other relevant
    accessibility metadata survived conversion.
-   Ensure essential information does not disappear when builds or
    animations are flattened.
-   Check the exported PDF or other distributed form separately rather
    than assuming the source deck's semantics were preserved.

# Projection and robustness

-   Design for the back of the room, not the author's laptop.
-   Use sufficiently thick lines, large marks, and clear labels in
    diagrams and charts.
-   Test important figures at realistic projected size rather than only
    at editing zoom.
-   Maintain strong foreground/background contrast.
-   Check that meaningful distinctions survive ordinary projectors and
    low-quality rendering.
-   Do not depend on subtle color differences or hairline strokes.
-   Ensure the deck remains intelligible after PDF export.

# Mechanical audit

Before considering a deck complete, check every slide and the deck as a
whole.

## Typography and titles

-   Is any audience-facing text below 20 pt?
-   Are ordinary slide titles one line?
-   Does each title communicate an idea, claim, question, or useful
    orientation rather than merely a topic?
-   Does every slide have a meaningful structural title?
-   Has any content been shrunk merely to make it fit?
-   Does any ordinary slide title end with a period?
-   Does audience-facing slide text contain an unnecessary em dash that should
    be rewritten?
-   Do comparable diagram labels use consistent typography?

## Content and hierarchy

-   Does every slide have a clear primary visual hierarchy?
-   Are any paragraphs or bullet walls duplicating speech?
-   Are labels readable from presentation distance?
-   Is any decorative element consuming attention without carrying
    meaning?
-   If a slide is dense, is the density evidence or useful structure
    rather than clutter?

## Figures and evidence

-   Are charts and diagrams directly annotated where useful?
-   Are axes, units, baselines, denominators, and other necessary
    context present?
-   Is the representation visually honest?
-   Does every meaningful visual have useful alt text?
-   Are decorative visuals marked decorative?
-   Do all meaningful connectors actually attach to their source and destination
    objects?
-   Could any diagonal box-to-box connector be routed more clearly as an
    orthogonal connector?
-   Are connector strokes and arrowheads heavy enough for projection?
-   Does every directed arrow point in the semantically correct direction?
-   Do connector routes avoid unnecessary collisions with labels, boxes, and
    other connectors?

## Accessibility

-   Is the object/reading order sensible?
-   Were objects created or reordered into the intended semantic
    sequence?
-   Is any essential meaning conveyed only by color, visual position,
    font styling, or an image of text?
-   Are links descriptively labeled?
-   Are tables and other structured objects reasonably simple and
    semantic?
-   Are captions or alternatives present for meaningful media?
-   Are citations readable?

## Builds and distribution

-   Does every build add meaning?
-   Are builds understandable in their final static state?
-   Does the deck remain usable after PDF export?
-   Did structural titles, alt text, links, reading order, and other
    accessibility semantics survive the distributed format?

## Speaker notes

When speaker notes are authored:

-   Does the first line use `<estimated time> — *<purpose/message>*`?
-   Is the time estimate plausible for the actual delivery or activity?
-   Does the italicized statement describe what the slide accomplishes rather than merely name its contents?
-   Are key presenter points captured above the `=====` delimiter?
-   If a transcript is present, is it below the delimiter?
-   Are meaningful speaking beats separated readably?
-   Does each `ANIMATE` marker correspond to an actual build and occur at the intended point in the spoken
    sequence?
-   Is any audience-essential information incorrectly available only in speaker notes?

Treat failures as defects unless there is a deliberate reason for the
exception. If an exception is necessary, preserve the underlying
communication and accessibility objective rather than mechanically
satisfying the surface rule.
