# slide.md — design the atomic visual unit

This is an **agent-facing** resource for designing an individual presentation slide.

A slide is not a page of prose.
It is a temporary visual field shown to an audience that is usually at a distance, listening at the same time, and unable to inspect every element equally.

The strongest foundations here are Michael Alley's **assertion–evidence** approach for technical presentations, Richard Mayer's research on multimedia learning, Edward Tufte's information-design principles, and Mike Morrison's Better Poster work on rapid acquisition and perceptual hierarchy.

The governing rule is:

> **Make the important idea perceptible, show enough evidence to judge it, and remove attention costs that do not carry meaning.**

This does not mean "make every slide minimal."
A rich technical figure can be excellent when its detail is evidence rather than clutter.

## Give the slide one primary job

Every slide should have an identifiable primary job.

Examples include:

- establish a claim;
- show evidence;
- pose a question;
- compare alternatives;
- expose a mechanism;
- establish scale;
- introduce vocabulary;
- prompt an activity;
- synthesize established concepts.

"One job" does **not** mean one fact, one object, or low information density.
A chart with twenty data points can perform one job.
A system diagram with twelve components can perform one job.

Split the slide when different regions compete for unrelated audience actions.

## Default to assertion → evidence

Michael Alley's assertion–evidence approach provides a strong default grammar for technical slides.

### Assertion

Prefer a title that states what the audience should conclude from the slide.

Weak:

> Performance Results

Stronger:

> Latency remains bounded as the workload grows

The stronger title tells the audience what relationship to inspect in the evidence.

An assertion title is a default, not a law.
Topic titles remain appropriate for genuine orientation, reference, activity, or section slides.

### Evidence

Use the body for the thing that lets the audience inspect, understand, or judge the assertion.

Evidence may be:

- a chart;
- a diagram;
- a table;
- a photograph;
- code;
- an equation;
- a measurement;
- a quotation;
- a worked example;
- an experimental artifact;
- a demonstration result.

Avoid **topic heading + bullet inventory** as the automatic structure for a technical slide.
If the content is fundamentally a list, a list may be correct.
Do not turn relational or evidentiary content into bullets merely because bullets are easy to author.

## Design for acquisition conditions

Mike Morrison's Better Poster work emphasizes a useful constraint: communication artifacts are encountered under real conditions, not inspected indefinitely at the author's preferred zoom level.

For a projected slide, the audience is typically:

- several meters away;
- seeing the slide temporarily;
- listening simultaneously;
- unable to allocate equal attention to every region.

Ask:

> What does the audience acquire in the first few seconds?

The primary message and visual hierarchy should survive that test.

This is not a requirement that every technical detail be understood instantly.
It is a requirement that the audience can quickly determine **what matters and where to look**.

## Layer information when the evidence supports it

A useful technical slide can support multiple acquisition depths:

1. **Immediate takeaway** — the primary claim or relationship.
2. **Inspectable evidence** — enough information to see why the claim is plausible.
3. **Fine detail** — values, labels, exceptions, or structure useful to technical scrutiny.

This reconciles Morrison's emphasis on rapid acquisition with Tufte's emphasis on information richness.

Do not confuse visual simplicity with informational poverty.

## Direct attention rather than decorating

Mayer's **signaling** principle says that cues can help learners identify the organization and important elements of material.

Useful signals include:

- position;
- scale;
- typographic weight;
- restrained highlighting;
- arrows;
- annotations;
- progressive reveal.

Use them to answer "where should I look?" or "what changed?"

Do not highlight everything.
A cue with no contrast carries no information.

## Coordinate the visual and spoken channels

Mayer's multimedia-learning work treats visual/pictorial and auditory/verbal processing as limited channels.
The practical consequence for slides is simple: do not routinely make the audience read the same narration it is hearing while also trying to inspect a visual.

Prefer:

- **slide:** evidence, structure, exact wording, comparison;
- **speech:** interpretation, connective reasoning, qualification.

If exact prose itself is the object of analysis—a requirement, quotation, legal clause, definition, or code fragment—show it.
If a graphic is the object of analysis, let the audience look at the graphic while the speaker explains it.

## Put labels beside what they describe

Mayer's **spatial contiguity** principle favors placing corresponding words and graphics near each other.

Prefer:

- labels directly on lines or regions;
- annotations beside the relevant feature;
- units next to values;
- short explanations adjacent to the object they explain.

Avoid making the audience repeatedly shuttle between a distant legend and the evidence.

Direct labeling also aligns with Tufte's information-design practice.

## Show the relevant thing when discussing it

Mayer's **temporal contiguity** principle favors presenting corresponding visual and verbal information together.

- Show the figure while explaining the figure.
- Reveal a new component when discussing that component.
- Do not display a complex diagram long before the audience has a reason to inspect it.
- Do not explain evidence several slides after removing it from view.

When a figure is too complex to process at once, use a sequence or build that preserves the frame while adding structure.

Progressive disclosure is a relationship between the slide's realized state sequence and the speaker's delivery. A proposed sequence is not an animation until it has actually been encoded in the presentation.

Use animation when successive states help the audience understand the idea: revealing successive elements of a process, shifting attention among parts of a model, or accumulating evidence. Do not animate merely because content can be revealed one bullet at a time.

An earlier state may remain visible but de-emphasized when the audience still needs it for context, and may disappear when it has completed its job. When several states or examples remain visible together, restrained borders can make the grouping and current focus legible.

## Choose the representation by the relation

Use the representation that naturally carries the content.

- **Text** — wording itself matters.
- **Photograph** — physical reality or appearance matters.
- **Diagram** — structure, mechanism, or relationship matters.
- **Chart** — quantitative pattern, trend, or distribution matters.
- **Table** — exact values or lookup/comparison matters.
- **Equation** — a formal relationship matters.
- **Code** — implementation detail or syntax matters.
- **Build / animation** — change, sequence, or progressive structure matters.

Do not draw merely because slides are visual.
Do not bullet-list a relationship whose important property is spatial, causal, temporal, or quantitative.

## Comparisons should expose the choice

When a slide teaches an alternative, pattern, design, or mechanism whose value
depends on what it is being compared with, show the meaningful alternative.

Prefer:

    recurring problem → alternative A / alternative B → consequences → tradeoff

over:

    named pattern → diagram → list of advantages and disadvantages

The comparison should make visible why a reasonable engineer might choose
either alternative. Do not present a catalogue of named solutions when the
learning objective is engineering judgment among them.

Keep alternatives visually comparable. Do not use layout, color, checkmarks,
or other emphasis to imply that one alternative is preferred unless the
argument actually establishes that preference.

## Preserve information integrity

Tufte's work provides the discipline for technical evidence.

### Show enough evidence

Do not reduce:

- a distribution to one average when spread matters;
- an experiment to a decorative percentage when the denominator matters;
- a system to generic boxes when structure matters;
- a comparison to adjectives when values are available.

The audience should see enough of the evidence to evaluate the claim at the resolution appropriate to the talk.

### Integrate words and graphics

Labels, values, annotations, and explanations should live near the evidence they interpret.
Do not artificially separate "the picture" from all of its language.

### Remove chartjunk

Decoration consumes attention.

Remove gradients, ornamental icons, unnecessary borders, 3-D effects, background imagery, redundant legends, and other marks that do not carry meaning.

### Preserve graphical honesty

Visual magnitude, area, scale, ordering, and emphasis should fairly represent the underlying evidence.
Do not make a small effect look large through graphical manipulation.

The goal is not maximum emptiness.

> **Reduce cognitive waste, not evidence.**

## Use economy without fetishizing minimalism

Every visible element consumes some attention.
Keep it when it carries:

- meaning;
- evidence;
- orientation;
- grouping;
- accessibility;
- provenance.

Remove it when it is merely furniture.

White space is useful when it establishes hierarchy or separation.
It is not an aesthetic quota.

A slide with one sentence and acres of empty space is not automatically better than a dense, well-labeled technical figure.

## Use text as a visual element

Slide prose should usually be shorter than document prose because the audience cannot read deeply and listen deeply at the same time.

Prefer:

- short assertion titles;
- direct labels;
- brief annotations;
- compact quotations;
- small numbers of deliberately structured bullets when a list is genuinely the content.

Avoid paragraphs unless reading the prose is itself the activity.

Do not shrink type to preserve wording that belongs in speech, notes, or a companion document.

## Make quantitative evidence perceptible

When the job is quantitative:

- use a chart for pattern;
- use a table for exact lookup;
- use a direct number when the number itself is the point;
- show denominators, uncertainty, baselines, or distributions when they materially affect interpretation;
- annotate the relevant comparison directly.

A large number in the center of a slide can be effective for scale.
It becomes misleading when the missing context is necessary to interpret it.

## Legibility and accessibility

Design for the room, not the laptop.

- Use type that remains legible from the back.
- Maintain sufficient foreground/background contrast.
- Do not encode meaning by color alone.
- Prefer direct labels.
- Keep important marks thick/large enough to survive projection.
- Preserve meaningful reading order.
- Where practical, ensure distinctions survive grayscale or weak projection.
- Provide alt text for meaningful visuals in distributed artifacts.

Accessibility supports the same objective as good visual design: the intended information should survive the conditions under which the audience receives it.

## Slide-level tests

### Job test

What is this slide supposed to change in the audience's understanding or attention?

If the answer is only "cover topic X," sharpen the job.

### Assertion test

If the slide makes a claim, does the title state the useful conclusion rather than merely name the topic?

### Evidence test

Can the audience see why the assertion should be believed or understood?

### Billboard test

From across the room and after a few seconds, what survives?
Is that the intended primary message?

### Squint test

When fine detail disappears, is the intended visual hierarchy still apparent?

### Competition test

Are multiple elements demanding attention for unrelated reasons?

### Redundancy test

Is substantial visible prose merely duplicating what the speaker will say?

### Contiguity test

Are labels and explanations near the objects they describe?

### Ink test

Can anything be removed without reducing evidence, meaning, orientation, accessibility, or provenance?

### Integrity test

Would a technically sophisticated audience regard the representation as a fair account of the underlying evidence?

A slide that fails one of these tests may still be correct—the principles have boundary conditions—but the failure should be deliberate rather than accidental.
