"""reflection_facet_bank_consistency.py — the ``bank_consistency`` reflection facet.

PORTABLE example facet. Reflection dimension: *paired-artifact consistency*.

This facet demonstrates a shape the two shipped facets (recurrence, memory-routing)
do NOT cover: the trigger is a Write/Edit to ONE member of a PAIRED status set, and
the reflection asks about the OTHER member's freshness. You just banked artifact A of
a pair (say a strategy file); artifact B (say a handoff file) is now STALE relative to
A — a resume that reads the pair gets a torn picture. So:

  - **other STALE** (or its mtime is unreadable) → FINISH-THE-BANK nudge: bank the
    OTHER now (ideally via the atomic dual-write banker, which moves both together),
    then keep going.
  - **both FRESH** (the other was banked within the freshness window) → PROCEED
    (silent): the pair is consistent, nothing to say.

This is the SOFT complement to the HARD ``StatusBanker`` (bank_status.py), which makes
the torn state impossible in the happy path by writing both atomically. Because the
atomic banker moves both mtimes together, "both fresh" is the common case and this
facet's nudge narrows to the DEGRADED path — a raw hand-edit of one file that bypassed
the atomic tool.

Fires on the ON_MEMORY_WRITE tempo (a PostToolUse ``Write|Edit``), the same discrete
operator-initiated-write window the memory-routing facet uses — distinct from the
recurring ON_TURN_END tick. Edge-triggered / deduped per the base's window discipline:
the emitter's per-path/per-branch dedupe absorbs a rapid same-branch repeat, and a
branch CHANGE (finish → consistent) is the useful edge that is never suppressed.

PARAMETERIZED. The artifact PAIR is not hardcoded to any project's two files. Set
``REFLECTION_BANK_PAIR`` to two ``os.pathsep``-joined absolute paths (the two files
this project banks together); the freshness window is ``REFLECTION_BANK_FRESH_S``.
Until you point it at a pair it is a safe no-op (a zero-config default).

ADOPTER NOTE — this facet uses a ``FacetKey.BANK_CONSISTENCY`` identity key. Add that
one line to the ``FacetKey`` enum in reflection_facet.py (a new dimension is a new key,
never a free string). Until you do, this module resolves the key defensively so it
still imports; the ``_bank_consistency_key`` shim below is the seam to delete once the
member exists.
