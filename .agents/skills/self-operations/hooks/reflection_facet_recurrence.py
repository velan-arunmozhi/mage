"""reflection_facet_recurrence.py — the ``failure_control`` reflection facet.

PORTABLE example facet. Reflection dimension: *failure → control*.

On a turn-end (when it is this facet's round-robin turn in the shared ON_TURN_END
window) it emits a conservative reminder: if the SAME failure has surfaced ≥2× this
session, stop re-patching the instance and convert the CLASS into a durable control
(a lint / gate / typed seam / test). The facet cannot itself detect a recurrence —
that is model judgment over the session's work — so it always emits the SAME
reminder; the "only on CLEAR evidence, otherwise say nothing" gate lives in the
payload WORDING, delegated to the operator's judgment.

The split of concerns:

  - **The facet** (this file) owns the POLICY: "when it is my turn, emit the
    failure→control self-check." Its ``check_policy_material`` returns ``NUDGE``
    unconditionally because the facet always has the same thing to say.
  - **The emitter** (hook_reflection_turn_end.py) owns the TEMPO: orchestrator
    context, the ≤1-per-window dedupe, the kill switch, telemetry — shared across
    all ON_TURN_END facets so a busy session still sees ≤1 reflection per window.

To adapt: change the ``policy_material`` pointers to YOUR hardening-discipline doc,
and re-word ``NUDGE_TEXT`` for your control vocabulary.

# WORDING IS THE CORE DESIGN WORK. Disarm-open ("soft; usually a no-op"), concrete
# (name the ≥2× trigger + the control kinds), explicit-escape ("if it hasn't
# recurred, proceed"), anti-manufacture ("don't invent a recurrence to justify
# acting"). Re-word this for your own hardening discipline.
NUDGE_TEXT = (
    "🛠  FAILURE→CONTROL SELF-CHECK (soft; usually a no-op — proceed by default). "
    "Before you finish: did the SAME failure surface twice or more this session — "
    "the same bug re-fixed, the same lint mis-firing, the same manual step re-done "
    "by hand? If so, the instance-level patch you just made won't stop the NEXT "
    "instance. Consider converting the CLASS into a durable control instead of only "
    "re-patching: a lint or gate that fires on the pattern, a typed seam that makes "
    "the mistake unrepresentable, a regression/property test that pins it, or a "
    "runtime guard. Hand the class to your hardening discipline (the partner "
    "self-governance skill's interpret-failure mode) — a designed, registered "
    "control, not an inline hack. If the failure has NOT recurred, proceed — this "
    "is usually the case, and manufacturing a control for a one-off is worse than "
    "missing one. Do NOT invent a recurrence to justify acting."
